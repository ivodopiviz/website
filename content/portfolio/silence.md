#### Description:

Small experimental sound-based game. The basic idea is to escape an alien ship using sounds as a guide. [It was successfully greenlit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=641097535) but not yet released.

The most interesting part is the semi-procedural level generation system that takes partial [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) maps and puts them together based on the desired difficulty of the level.

It'll be eventually released for Windows, Mac and Linux.
