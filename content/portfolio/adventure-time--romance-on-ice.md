#### Description:

Heavily inspired by [Solipskier](http://mikengreg.com/solipskier/), this game was made for the latin american branch of Cartoon Network, later released all around the world. [You can still play it if you want](http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/games/adventure-time-romance-on-ice).

Even though it was already being phased out, the game had to be coded in Flash and compatible with older versions of the Flash Player. There were also pretty strict performance and size limitations that had to be taken into account.

The most interesting part of this game to implement was the heightmap-based snow system. Just like in Solipskier the player could "draw" the snow using the mouse. Getting it to look good and run fast enough with the limitations we had was quite the challenge.

#### Technologies:

Flash
