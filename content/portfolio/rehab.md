#### Description:

This was a very interesting project for rehabilitation of patients with neuro-motor problems. It was a suite of minigames, all of them using the Kinect camera to detect gestures trained with machine learning techniques.

The main challenge was creating a system that would give accurate detection but at the same time allow to be configured lenient enough to account for each patient capabilities.

The system included user account suppor and full activity logging, intended to be shared with the medical staff.

#### Technologies:

Unity 5.6
