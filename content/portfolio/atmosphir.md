### Atmosphir

![](/uploads/2018/05/08/atmosphir.jpg)

#### Description:

A very interesting project mix of platformer and level editor, made for the now defunct [Minor Studios](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/minor-studios#section-overview). The game was made with a very early version of what would eventually become [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and used Lua for scripting. Players could share their creations and challenge each map to set the fastest times.

This project would then move onto be developed by Minor Studios itself, getting ported to Unity and expanded significantly, but I wasn't involved anymore by that stage.

#### Technologies:

C++

Lua
