#### Description:

The same first person RPG released on GBA, but ported to Nintendo DS, with the big change of being now in full 3D. This was my first serious work as a programmer. It was a difficult first project because the GBA and the DS were pretty different and the original GBA version was written with a homebrew SDK.

#### Technologies:

C

Lua
