### AAA: Heroes del Ring

![](/uploads/2018/05/08/caa8bc24566711.5604a6b3f0147.jpg)

#### Description:

The PSP adaptation of a game released for Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. I wasn't directly involved in the development of the game itself but on the actual port of the Torque 3D engine to the PSP platform.

It was an extremely difficult project that didn't quite work out, but it's to this day one of the biggest learning experiences of my professional career.

#### Technologies:

Torque 3D

C++
