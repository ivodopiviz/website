And just like this, I start a new website (yet) again. I'll try to write a little bit about my personal projects, my experiences and anything that might come to mind.

Yes, it's pretty barebones at the moment, but you have to start somewhere right? I'll make sure to keep adding content regularly.

Enjoy your stay :)
