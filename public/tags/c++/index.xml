      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of general bugfixing in Godot lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the engine in one way or another for quite a few years now and contributing to open source projects is always very rewarding.</description>

      <description>I wrote Octo to teach myself emulator programming. I&amp;rsquo;m not very sure it was very successful really, it&amp;rsquo;s and extremely simple system and very, very easy to emulate.</description>

      <description>AAA: Heroes del Ring Description: The PSP adaptation of a game released for Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t directly involved in the development of the game itself but on the actual port of the Torque 3D engine to the PSP platform.
It was an extremely difficult project that didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work out, but it&amp;rsquo;s to this day one of the biggest learning experiences of my professional career.

      <description>Description: Port of the PC graphical adventure, this time for the Sony PSP console. This project was part of an incubator program Sony Computer Entertainment started in Latin America. The publisher liked it very much, but unfortunately cancelled the project due to lack of funds.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really involved in the gameplay itself, I spent most of my time getting out small in-house engine running on the PSP and integrating some of the SDK libraries to save time.</description>

      <description>Atmosphir Description: A very interesting project mix of platformer and level editor, made for the now defunct Minor Studios. The game was made with a very early version of what would eventually become Godot Engine and used Lua for scripting. Players could share their creations and challenge each map to set the fastest times.
This project would then move onto be developed by Minor Studios itself, getting ported to Unity and expanded significantly, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t involved anymore by that stage.</description>

      <description>Description: Port of the PC graphical adventure to Nintendo DS, unfortunately never released because of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s lack of funds. I worked mostly on the small custom engine that was made compatible with the original game&amp;rsquo;s Lua scripts.
