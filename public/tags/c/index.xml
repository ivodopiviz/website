      <description>Description: The same first person RPG released on GBA, but ported to Nintendo DS, with the big change of being now in full 3D. This was my first serious work as a programmer. It was a difficult first project because the GBA and the DS were pretty different and the original GBA version was written with a homebrew SDK.

      <description>Mazes of Fate Description: My first project in the videogame industry. An old school first person RPG for the Nintendo Gameboy Advance. I believe it was one of the first latin american games released on a Nintendo console. I started off as a QA tester and ended up doing plenty of production work and some light scripting.
