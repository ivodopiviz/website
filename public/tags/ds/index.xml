      <description>Description: Port of the PC graphical adventure to Nintendo DS, unfortunately never released because of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s lack of funds. I worked mostly on the small custom engine that was made compatible with the original game&amp;rsquo;s Lua scripts.

      <description>Description: The same first person RPG released on GBA, but ported to Nintendo DS, with the big change of being now in full 3D. This was my first serious work as a programmer. It was a difficult first project because the GBA and the DS were pretty different and the original GBA version was written with a homebrew SDK.
