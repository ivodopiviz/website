      <description>Description: Pretty standard web tower defense game developed for Cartoon Network latin america. Like most of CN&amp;rsquo;s web games, we had fairly strict size and performance limitations to hit. You can still play it online.
Technologies: Haxe

      <description>Description: Heavily inspired by Solipskier, this game was made for the latin american branch of Cartoon Network, later released all around the world. You can still play it if you want.
Even though it was already being phased out, the game had to be coded in Flash and compatible with older versions of the Flash Player. There were also pretty strict performance and size limitations that had to be taken into account.</description>
