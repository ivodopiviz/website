      <description>Description: Small experimental sound-based game. The basic idea is to escape an alien ship using sounds as a guide. It was successfully greenlit but not yet released.
The most interesting part is the semi-procedural level generation system that takes partial Tiled maps and puts them together based on the desired difficulty of the level.
It&amp;rsquo;ll be eventually released for Windows, Mac and Linux.
