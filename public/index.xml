      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing quite a bit of general bugfixing in Godot lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with the engine in one way or another for quite a few years now and contributing to open source projects is always very rewarding.</description>

      <description>I wrote Octo to teach myself emulator programming. I&amp;rsquo;m not very sure it was very successful really, it&amp;rsquo;s and extremely simple system and very, very easy to emulate.</description>

      <description>And just like this, I start a new website (yet) again. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write a little bit about my personal projects, my experiences and anything that might come to mind.
Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty barebones at the moment, but you have to start somewhere right? I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure to keep adding content regularly.
Enjoy your stay :)</description>
